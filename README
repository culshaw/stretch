Stretch jQuery Plugin:

Expands text to fill up the entire width of its parent (or at least as much
as possible). It does this in 2 ways. First, it finds the largest font-size
for the text that can still fits on one line. If there is still some space
left to fill, it will increase the gap between the words as well to fill the
remaining space.

For example, say we wanted to make the following title, "Sprockets and 
Widgets" take up as much of the full 400px of width as possible:

    <h1 style="width: 400px">Sprockets and Widgets</h1>
    <script>
        $("h1").contents().fillWidth();
     </script>

The actual implementation runs in O(log n) time, where n is the width of the
container. This makes it more efficient than many existing solutions.
